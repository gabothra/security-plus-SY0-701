# Audits and Assessments

## Attestation
- **Attestation**: Formal declaration or confirmation provided by individuals or entities to affirm the accuracy, truthfulness, or compliance with specific requirements. It often involves signing a document or providing testimony to validate the authenticity or validity of certain information or assertions.

## Internal
- **Compliance**: Internal assessments conducted to ensure adherence to organizational policies, procedures, and regulatory requirements. These assessments may include reviewing controls, processes, and documentation to verify compliance with established standards.
- **Audit Committee**: A group within an organization responsible for overseeing audit processes, including the appointment of auditors, review of audit findings, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
- **Self-Assessments**: Evaluations performed by individuals or departments within an organization to assess their own performance, adherence to policies, and compliance with internal controls. Self-assessments help identify areas for improvement and ensure ongoing compliance.

## External
- **Regulatory**: Audits conducted by regulatory authorities or government agencies to assess compliance with laws, regulations, and industry standards. Regulatory audits may include on-site inspections, document reviews, and interviews to verify compliance with specific requirements.
- **Examinations**: Formal reviews or assessments conducted by external auditors or examiners to evaluate the financial statements, internal controls, and compliance practices of an organization. Examinations may be required for regulatory compliance or as part of contractual agreements.
- **Assessment**: Evaluation or analysis performed by external parties, such as consultants or third-party auditors, to assess the effectiveness of controls, processes, and risk management practices within an organization. Assessments help identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.
- **Independent Third-Party Audit**: Audits conducted by external auditors or audit firms that are independent of the organization being audited. These audits provide an objective assessment of compliance with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and best practices.

## Penetration Testing
- **Physical**: Penetration tests focused on assessing the security of physical infrastructure, facilities, and assets. Physical penetration testing involves attempting to gain unauthorized access to buildings, premises, or sensitive areas to identify security vulnerabilities.
- **Offensive**: Penetration tests conducted from the perspective of a malicious attacker to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. Offensive penetration testing helps organizations understand their security posture and prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Defensive**: Penetration tests designed to simulate real-world attack scenarios and test the effectiveness of defensive measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and security controls. Defensive penetration testing helps organizations improve their security defenses and incident response capabilities.
- **Integrated**: Penetration testing approaches that combine offensive and defensive techniques to comprehensively assess an organization's security posture. Integrated penetration testing may involve testing both technical and physical security controls to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- **Known Environment**: Penetration tests conducted in environments where the attacker has prior knowledge of the systems, networks, or applications being tested. Known environment penetration testing allows testers to focus on specific areas of concern and simulate targeted attacks.
- **Partially Known Environment**: Penetration tests conducted in environments where the attacker has limited knowledge or access to the systems, networks, or applications being tested. Partially known environment penetration testing simulates scenarios where attackers have some information but need to gather additional intelligence to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Unknown Environment**: Penetration tests conducted in environments where the attacker has no prior knowledge or access to the systems, networks, or applications being tested. Unknown environment penetration testing simulates scenarios where attackers have to discover and exploit vulnerabilities without any prior information.
- **Reconnaissance**:
    - **Passive**: Gathering information about systems, networks, or applications without directly interacting with them. Passive reconnaissance techniques include collecting publicly available information, analyzing network traffic, and monitoring social media channels.
    - **Active**: Actively probing and scanning systems, networks, or applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Active reconnaissance techniques involve sending requests, probes, or queries to target systems to gather information about their configuration, services, and potential security flaws.
