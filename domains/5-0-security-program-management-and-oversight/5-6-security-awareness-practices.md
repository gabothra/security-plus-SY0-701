# Implement Security Awareness Practices

## Phishing
- **Campaigns**: Organized efforts to simulate phishing attacks on employees or users within an organization. Phishing campaigns are designed to raise awareness about the tactics used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing malicious actions.
- **Recognizing a Phishing Attempt**: Educating users on how to identify phishing attempts by recognizing common characteristics such as suspicious email addresses, spelling errors, urgent requests for personal information, and unsolicited attachments or links.
- **Responding to Reported Suspicious Messages**: Establishing procedures for users to report suspicious messages or phishing attempts to the appropriate IT or security teams for investigation and response.

## Anomalous Behavior Recognition
- **Risky**: Identifying behaviors or activities that pose a risk to the security of the organization, such as accessing unauthorized resources, sharing sensitive information externally, or violating security policies.
- **Unexpected**: Noticing unusual or unexpected behavior patterns that deviate from typical user activity or system behavior, which may indicate a security incident or compromise.
- **Unintentional**: Recognizing inadvertent actions or mistakes that could result in security vulnerabilities or data breaches, such as accidentally clicking on malicious links or sending sensitive information to the wrong recipient.

## User Guidance and Training
- **Policy/Handbooks**: Providing users with clear guidelines, policies, and handbooks that outline security best practices, acceptable use policies, and procedures for handling sensitive information.
- **Situational Awareness**: Educating users on the importance of maintaining situational awareness and being vigilant about potential security threats or suspicious activities in their environment.
- **Insider Threat**: Raising awareness about the risks posed by insider threats and providing training on how to recognize and report suspicious behavior or insider attacks.
- **Password Management**: Offering guidance and training on creating strong, unique passwords, avoiding password reuse, and securely managing passwords to protect against credential theft and unauthorized access.
- **Removable Media and Cables**: Instructing users on the risks associated with using removable media (such as USB drives) and cables (such as charging cables) and best practices for securely handling and connecting external devices to prevent malware infections or data loss.
- **Social Engineering**: Training users to recognize and resist social engineering tactics used by attackers to manipulate individuals into disclosing sensitive information, performing actions, or bypassing security controls.
- **Operational Security**: Educating users on the importance of operational security (OPSEC) practices, such as limiting the disclosure of sensitive information, practicing good cybersecurity hygiene, and being cautious about sharing personal or organizational details online.
- **Hybrid/Remote Work Environment**: Providing guidance and training to users working in hybrid or remote environments on how to securely access corporate resources, use collaboration tools, and protect sensitive information outside of the traditional office setting.

## Reporting and Monitoring
- **Initial**: Establishing procedures for users to report security incidents, suspicious activities, or policy violations to the appropriate IT or security teams for investigation and response.
- **Recurring**: Conducting regular security awareness training sessions, refresher courses, or simulated phishing exercises to reinforce good security practices, raise awareness about emerging threats, and ensure ongoing vigilance among users.

## Development
- **Development**: Continuously developing and improving security awareness programs, training materials, and resources based on feedback, lessons learned from security incidents, and changes in the threat landscape.

## Execution
- **Execution**: Implementing security awareness practices effectively across the organization through consistent communication, engagement, and support from leadership, management, and stakeholders.
