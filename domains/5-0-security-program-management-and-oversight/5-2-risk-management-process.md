# Risk Management Process

## Risk Assessment

## Risk Identification
- **Ad hoc**: Informal identification of risks as they arise.
- **Recurring**: Regularly scheduled risk identification processes.
- **One-time**: Specific efforts to identify risks for a particular project or initiative.
- **Continuous**: Ongoing monitoring and identification of risks throughout operations.

## Risk Analysis
- **Qualitative**: Subjective assessment of risks based on their impact and likelihood.
- **Quantitative**: Objective assessment of risks using numerical data and calculations.
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**: Monetary value associated with a single occurrence of a risk.
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**: Estimated financial impact of a risk over a year.
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**: Frequency with which a risk is expected to occur.
- **Probability**: Likelihood of a risk event occurring.
- **Exposure Factor**: Percentage of asset value lost due to a risk event.
- **Impact**: Consequences of a risk event.

### Formulas
- **Exposure Factor**
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)**:
  - SLE = AV (asset value) x EF (Exposure factor)
- **Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)**:
  - ALE = SLE x ARO
- **Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)**:
  - ARO = 

## Risk Register
- Document that captures identified risks, their attributes, and management strategies.
- Includes key risk indicators, risk owners, and risk thresholds.

## Risk Tolerance

## Risk Appetite
- **Expansionary**: Willingness to take on more risk to pursue growth opportunities.
- **Conservative**: Preference for minimizing risk exposure even if it limits potential gains.
- **Neutral**: Balanced approach to risk management without bias towards risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviors.

## Risk Management Strategies
- **Transfer**: Shifting risk to another party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.
- **Accept**: Acknowledging the existence of a risk and deciding not to take further action.
  - **Exemption**: Specific situations where certain risks are deemed acceptable.
  - **Exception**: Instances where deviation from standard risk management practices is allowed.
- **Avoid**: Taking actions to eliminate or minimize the likelihood of a risk occurring.
- **Mitigate**: Implementing measures to reduce the impact or likelihood of a risk.

## Risk Reporting

## Business Impact Analysis
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime for restoring operations after a disruption.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss during a disruption.
- **Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: Average time it takes to restore functionality after a failure.
- **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: Average time between system failures.
