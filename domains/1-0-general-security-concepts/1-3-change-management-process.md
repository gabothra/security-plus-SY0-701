# Change Management Process

Change management is like a set of rules and steps we follow when we want to make changes to how things work, ensuring everything stays safe and works well.

### Business Processes Impacting Security Operation

These are the important steps and people involved when making changes:

- **Approval Process**: Like getting permission from your parents before doing something.
- **Ownership**: Knowing who is responsible for what, like who owns which toy.
- **Stakeholders**: People who care about the change, like your friends who also play with your toys.
- **Impact Analysis**: Thinking about what could happen if you make the change, like deciding if moving your toys will make a mess.
- **Test Results**: Checking if the change works, like testing a new game to see if it’s fun.
- **Backout Plan**: A plan to undo the change if it doesn’t work, like having a backup plan if a new game isn’t fun.
- **Maintenance Window**: The best time to make changes, like picking a good time to clean your room.
- **Standard Operating Procedure**: The usual way to do things, like your daily routine.

### Technical Implications

These are the technical things to consider when making changes:

- **Allow List/Deny List**: Lists of what is allowed and what isn’t, like who can and can’t come to your party.
- **Restricted Activities**: Things you aren’t allowed to do, like no running inside the house.
- **Downtime**: Time when things aren’t working, like when your internet is down.
- **Service Restart**: Turning things off and on again, like rebooting your computer.
- **Application Restart**: Restarting apps, like closing and reopening a game.
- **Legacy Applications**: Old apps that still need to work, like an old favorite toy.
- **Dependencies**: Things that depend on each other, like needing batteries for a toy.

### Documentation

Keeping everything updated and organized:

- **Updating Diagrams**: Drawing new maps or plans.
- **Updating Policies/Procedures**: Writing down the new rules or steps.

### Version Control

Version control is like keeping track of different versions of your drawings to see what changes were made.

## Change Management vs. Change Control

- **Change Management**: The big plan or policy for how we handle changes in an organization, like house rules for making changes.
- **Change Control**: The specific process of looking at a change request to decide if it should happen, like asking your parents if you can change the rules of a game.
