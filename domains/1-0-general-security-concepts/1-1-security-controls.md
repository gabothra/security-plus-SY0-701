### Security Controls - security measures to help minimize loss or unavalibility of services or apps due to vulnerablities.

# Categories of Security Controls

1. **Technical** 
    - Hardware or software mechanisms which can be used to manage access to resources and systems and also provide protection to those resources.
> ### Examples
> - Encryption
> - Smart Cards
> - Passwords
> - Biometrics
> - Access Control Lists (ACL's)
> - Firewall, routers
> - IDS/IPS
2. **Managerial**
    - These are basically policies or procedures which are defined by the organisations security policy.
    - There can be various types of **planning and assessment methods** which can be used to **review organisations ability to manage and reduce risk.**
> ### Examples
> - Policies
> - Procedures
> - Hiring practices
> - Background checks
> - Data classification
> - Security training
> - Risk assessments
> - Vulnerability assessments
3. **Operational [New in SY0-701]**
    - As the name suggests, this is a type where it is ensured that **day-to-day operations** of the organisation comply with the overall security.
    - This is primarily **implemented by people** and not machines.
    - The people here while ensuring security use technology which is defined through the ***Technical*** section. 
> ### Examples
> - Awareness training
> - Configuration Management
> - Media protection
4. **Physical**
    - These are tye type of security mechanisms which are focused on providing security to **real world objects including facility where the objects are**
    - **Protecting what we can touch**
> ### Examples
> - Guards
> - Fences
> - Lights
> - Motion detectors
> - Guard dogs
> - Video Cameras
> - Alarms
> - Laptop locks

> ## Summary
> - Technical - ***Technology (HW & SW)***
> - Physical - ***Tangible***
> - Managerial - ***Policy (and policy implementation)***
> - Operational - ***People (doing stuff)***
> - Physical --> Operational --> Technical --> Managerial --> Assets 

# Types of Security Controls

***Controls can fit into multiple types based on the context and the situation.***

1. **Preventive** - deployed to **stop unauthorized activity** from occuring. 

    > Preventive is also a Deterrent
2. **Deterrent** - deployed to **discourage violation** of security policies.
3. **Detective** - deployed to **discover or detect** unwanted activity.
4. **Corrective** - modifies the environment to **return back to normal** after an unwanted activity has occured. 
5. **Compensating** - provides options to **other existing controls to aid in** enforcement of security policies. [Supporting or redundant controls]
6. **Directive** - **direct, confine or control** the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance with security policies.

## Extras
### Difference between safeguards and countermeasures
- Safeguards - are proactive **(reduce likelihood of occurance)**
- Countermeasures - are reactive **(reduce impact after occurance)**

### Control can overlap i.e. One control, multiple type/functions

### Focus on keywords
1. Deterrent: **"Warning"**, **"Sign"**, **"Visibility"**, **"Perception"**
2. Preventive: **"Access control"**, **"Authentication"**, **"Firewall"**, **"Encryption"**
3. Directive: **"Policy"**, **"Procedure"**, **"Standard"**, **"Guideline"**
4. Detective: **"Monitoring"**, **"Audit"**, **"Logging"**, **"Alert"**
5. Corrective: **"Backup"**, **"Restore"**, **"Incident response"**, **"Patching"**
6. Compensating: **"Alternative"**, **"Backup"**, **"Redundancy"**

**Note: You should know some of the examples of each type of security controls as listed above.**
