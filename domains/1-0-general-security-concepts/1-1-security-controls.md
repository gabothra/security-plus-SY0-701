## Security Controls

**Security controls** are like rules and tools that help protect our things, such as services or apps, from getting lost or not working because of problems (called vulnerabilities).

### Categories of Security Controls

#### 1. Technical

Technical controls are like gadgets and software that help keep our stuff safe and make sure only the right people can use them.

**Examples:**
- **Encryption**: This is like a secret code that only certain people can read.
- **Smart Cards**: These are special cards that let you into places or systems.
- **Passwords**: Secret words or phrases only you know.
- **Biometrics**: Using your fingerprint or face to unlock things.
- **Access Control Lists (ACL's)**: Lists that say who can and can't use something.
- **Firewall, Routers**: Gadgets that keep bad guys out of your computer network.
- **IDS/IPS**: Tools that watch out for bad guys and stop them.

#### 2. Managerial

Managerial controls are like the rules and plans that organizations use to keep things safe.

**Examples:**
- **Policies**: Rules everyone has to follow.
- **Procedures**: Steps to do things the right way.
- **Hiring Practices**: Making sure you hire good and trustworthy people.
- **Background Checks**: Checking if someone has done bad things before.
- **Data Classification**: Deciding what information is most important.
- **Security Training**: Teaching people how to stay safe.
- **Risk Assessments**: Figuring out what could go wrong.
- **Vulnerability Assessments**: Finding things that could be broken or used by bad guys.

#### 3. Operational (New in SY0-701)

Operational controls are about making sure everyday work follows the safety rules. People do these tasks, not machines.

**Examples:**
- **Awareness Training**: Teaching everyone about safety rules.
- **Configuration Management**: Keeping track of how everything is set up.
- **Media Protection**: Keeping things like USB drives and CDs safe.

#### 4. Physical

Physical controls are about protecting real-world objects, like the building where you keep your stuff.

**Examples:**
- **Guards**: People who watch over things.
- **Fences**: Barriers that keep people out.
- **Lights**: Bright lights that make it hard for bad guys to hide.
- **Motion Detectors**: Gadgets that sense if someone is moving.
- **Guard Dogs**: Dogs that watch over and protect places.
- **Video Cameras**: Cameras that record what’s happening.
- **Alarms**: Loud noises that warn you if something’s wrong.
- **Laptop Locks**: Locks that keep your computer safe.

### Summary

- **Technical**: Using technology (hardware & software).
- **Physical**: Things you can touch.
- **Managerial**: Rules and plans.
- **Operational**: People doing stuff.
- **Physical** -> **Operational** -> **Technical** -> **Managerial** -> Assets

### Types of Security Controls

Security controls can be used in different ways depending on the situation.

#### 1. Preventive

Preventive controls stop bad things from happening.

**Examples:**
- **Access Control**
- **Authentication**
- **Firewall**
- **Encryption**

#### 2. Deterrent

Deterrent controls make people think twice before doing something bad.

**Examples:**
- **Warning Signs**
- **Visible Security Cameras**

#### 3. Detective

Detective controls find out if something bad has happened.

**Examples:**
- **Monitoring**
- **Audit**
- **Logging**
- **Alert**

#### 4. Corrective

Corrective controls fix things after something bad has happened.

**Examples:**
- **Backup**
- **Restore**
- **Incident Response**
- **Patching**

#### 5. Compensating

Compensating controls help support other controls to keep things safe.

**Examples:**
- **Alternative Measures**
- **Redundancy**

#### 6. Directive

Directive controls give instructions to make sure people follow the rules.

**Examples:**
- **Policies**
- **Procedures**
- **Standards**
- **Guidelines**

### Extras

#### Difference Between Safeguards and Countermeasures

- **Safeguards**: Proactive measures to reduce the chance of something bad happening.
- **Countermeasures**: Reactive measures to reduce the impact after something bad happens.

#### Control Overlap

One control can have multiple functions or types.
