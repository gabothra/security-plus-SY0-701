# Domain 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations

## Section 2: Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

### Threat Vector

A threat vector is like a path that attackers use to sneak into a computer system or network without permission.

### Attack Surface

The attack surface is like all the doors and windows an attacker could use to get into a system. It's like a map of weaknesses.

### Message-based

- **Email**: Attackers can send malicious emails with links or attachments that, when clicked or opened, can compromise the system.
- **SMS**: Similar to email attacks, but using text messages instead.
- **Instant Messaging (IM)**: Attackers can use messaging apps to send malicious links or files to victims.

### Image-based

- Images can contain hidden malware or malicious code that can exploit vulnerabilities in image-processing software.

### File-based

- Files, such as documents or executables, can contain malware or scripts that exploit vulnerabilities in the software used to open them.

### Voice Call

- Voice calls can be used to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or account details.

### Removable Device

- Removable devices like USB drives can carry malware that infects systems when inserted.

### Vulnerable Software

- **Client-based vs. Agentless**: Vulnerabilities in software installed on client devices or systems, or vulnerabilities in agentless systems that rely on network-based services.

### Unsupported Systems and Applications

- Systems or applications that no longer receive security updates or patches, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits and attacks.

### Unsecure Networks

- **Wireless**: Insecure Wi-Fi networks can be exploited by attackers to intercept traffic or launch attacks.
- **Wired**: Vulnerabilities in wired network infrastructure, such as switches or routers, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
- **Bluetooth**: Insecure Bluetooth connections can be exploited to gain access to devices or intercept communications.

### Open Service Ports

- Open ports on systems or network devices can provide entry points for attackers to gain unauthorized access.

### Default Credentials

- Default usernames and passwords that are unchanged from their factory settings can be easily guessed by attackers.

### Supply Chain

- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs)**: Third-party providers that manage IT services for organizations can be targeted to gain access to their clients' networks.
- **Vendors**: Suppliers or vendors that provide software or hardware components to organizations can be compromised to introduce vulnerabilities into their products.
- **Suppliers**: External suppliers or partners that have access to an organization's systems or data can be targeted to steal sensitive information or launch attacks.

## Social Engineering

Social engineering is like tricking people into giving away sensitive information.

### Principles of Social Engineering

- **Authority**: Pretending to be someone important.
- **Intimidation**: Making people scared so they'll do what you want.
- **Consensus**: Making people think everyone else is doing it.
- **Scarcity**: Making something seem rare or hard to get.
- **Familiarity**: Pretending to be someone the victim knows.
- **Trust**: Making the victim believe you're trustworthy.
- **Urgency**: Making people act quickly without thinking.

### Human Vectors/Social Engineering

- **Phishing**: Sending fake emails or messages to trick people.
  - *Spear Phishing*: Targeting specific users or groups.
  - *Whaling*: Targeting high-level executives.
- **Vishing**: Phishing over the phone.
- **Smishing**: Phishing through text messages.
- **Misinformation/Disinformation**: Spreading lies or fake news.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else.
- **Business Email Compromise**: Hacking into email accounts for fraud.
- **Pretexting**: Making up a fake story to trick someone.
- **Watering Hole**: Attacking through untrusted websites.
- **Brand Impersonation**: Pretending to be a trusted brand.
- **Typosquatting [URL Hijacking]**: Using misspelled website addresses to trick people.
