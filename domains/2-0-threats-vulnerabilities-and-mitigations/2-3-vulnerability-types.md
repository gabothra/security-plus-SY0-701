# Domain 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations

## Section 3: Types of Vulnerabilities

### Vulnerability

A vulnerability is like a weakness in a system, application, or infrastructure that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or cause damage.

### Threat

A threat is like a potential event that could exploit a vulnerability and cause harm.

### Exploit

An exploit is like a specific method or tool used to take advantage of a vulnerability.

### Attack

An attack is like an actual attempt to exploit a vulnerability to achieve a malicious goal.

### Application

- **Memory Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to insert malicious code into a program's memory.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Overwriting memory buffers to execute arbitrary code.
- **Race Conditions**: Exploiting timing issues in concurrent processes.
  - *Time-of-Check (TOC)*: Exploiting a time gap between checking a condition and using the result.
  - *Time-of-Use (TOU)*: Exploiting a time gap between validating data and using it.
- **Malicious Update**: Exploiting weaknesses in update mechanisms to deliver malware.

### OS-based

- **Default Settings**: Exploiting vulnerabilities caused by default configurations.
- **Configurations/Misconfigurations**: Misconfiguring systems or applications, leaving them vulnerable.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access.
- **Zero-Day**: Exploiting vulnerabilities that are unknown to the public or vendor.

### Web-based

- **SQL Injection**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications' database queries.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

### Hardware

- **Firmware**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in firmware, which is software embedded in hardware devices.
- **End-of-Life**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware that is no longer supported by the manufacturer.
- **Legacy**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated hardware.

### Virtualization

- **Virtual Machine Escape**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in virtualization software to break out of a virtual machine's isolation.
- **Resource Reuse**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to access resources allocated to other virtual machines.

### Cloud-specific

- **Data Breaches**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to access sensitive data stored in the cloud.
- **Misconfiguration and Inadequate Control**: Misconfiguring cloud services or lacking proper access controls.
- **Lack of Cloud Security Architecture and Strategy**: Failing to implement comprehensive security measures for cloud environments.
- **Insufficient Identity, Credential Access, and Key Management**: Poor management of user identities, credentials, and encryption keys.
- **Account Hijacking**: Unauthorized access to cloud user accounts.
- **Insider Threat**: Malicious activities by authorized users within an organization.
- **Insecure Interfaces and APIs**: Vulnerabilities in interfaces used to access cloud services.
- **Weak Control Plane**: Vulnerabilities in the control layer of cloud services.
- **Metastructure and Applistructure Failures**: Failures in the underlying infrastructure supporting cloud services.
- **Limited Cloud Usage Visibility**: Inability to monitor and analyze cloud usage for security threats.
- **Abuse and Nefarious Use of Cloud Services**: Exploiting cloud services for malicious purposes.

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- Selecting a Qualified CSP (Cloud Service Provider)
- Integrating Security into Every Step, Starting with Design
- Implementing Storage and Database Encryption at Rest, and TLS & VPN for Data in Transit

### Supply Chain

- **Service Provider**: Securing relationships with third-party service providers.
- **Hardware Provider**: Ensuring hardware components are sourced from trusted suppliers.
- **Software Provider**: Using reputable software vendors and ensuring software is up-to-date.

### Cryptographic

- **Weak Encryption**: Using encryption algorithms with known vulnerabilities.
- **Improper Key Management**: Poorly managing encryption keys, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Inadequate Randomness**: Generating cryptographic keys using insufficiently random processes.
- **Inadequate Authentication**: Weak authentication mechanisms that can be easily bypassed.
- **Key Lifetimes**: Using cryptographic keys for too long without rotation.
- **Public Key Length**: Using public key cryptography with inadequate key lengths.
- **Symmetric Key Length**: Using symmetric encryption keys that are too short.

### Misconfiguration

- Misconfiguring systems, applications, or networks, which can introduce vulnerabilities.

### Mobile Device

- **Side Loading**: Installing apps from unofficial sources, which may contain malware.
- **Jailbreaking**: Removing software restrictions on mobile devices, making them more vulnerable.

### Zero-Day

- Exploiting vulnerabilities that are unknown to the public or vendor, providing attackers with a window of opportunity to launch attacks.
