# Security Alerting and Monitoring

## Monitoring Computing Resources
Security alerting and monitoring involve monitoring various computing resources, including:
- Systems
- Applications
- Infrastructure

## Activities
Key activities involved in security alerting and monitoring are as follows:
- **Log Aggregation**: Collecting and consolidating logs from different sources for analysis.
- **Alerting**: Generating alerts based on predefined criteria or thresholds to indicate potential security incidents.
- **Scanning**: Conducting scans to detect vulnerabilities, malware, or unauthorized activities.
- **Reporting**: Generating reports to provide insights into security events, trends, and metrics.
- **Archiving**: Storing historical data and logs for future reference and analysis.
- **Alert Response and Remediation/Validation**: Responding to security alerts promptly, investigating incidents, and validating remediation measures.
- **Quarantine**: Isolating or containing compromised systems or assets to prevent further damage.
- **Alert Tuning**: Fine-tuning alerting rules and thresholds to reduce false positives and improve detection accuracy.

## Tools
Various tools and technologies are used for security alerting and monitoring, including:
- **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**: A set of open standards for automating vulnerability management, security measurement, and compliance assessment.
- **Benchmarks**: Industry-standard benchmarks and best practices for configuring and securing systems and networks.
- **Agents/Agentless**: Monitoring solutions may utilize agents installed on endpoints or operate agentlessly, depending on the deployment requirements.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**: Platforms that collect, correlate, and analyze security event data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive threat detection and response capabilities.
- **Antivirus**: Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malware from systems and networks.
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Solutions that monitor and prevent the unauthorized transfer or leakage of sensitive data.
- **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Traps**: SNMP traps are asynchronous notifications used to alert monitoring systems of specific events or conditions in network devices.
- **NetFlow**: A network protocol used for monitoring and analyzing network traffic flow data.
- **Vulnerability Scanners**: Tools that identify and assess vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications.
