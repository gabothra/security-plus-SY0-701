# Apply Common Security Techniques

## Secure Baselines
- **Establish**: Define a set of secure configurations and settings for various systems and devices based on industry best practices and organizational requirements.
- **Deploy**: Implement the secure baselines across the organization's IT infrastructure, ensuring consistency and adherence to security standards.
- **Maintain**: Regularly review and update the secure baselines to address emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and changes in business needs.

## Hardening Targets
- Secure configuration and strengthening of various types of devices and systems to reduce their attack surface and improve their resilience against cyber threats. Examples include:
  - Mobile devices
  - Workstations
  - Switches
  - Routers
  - Cloud infrastructure
  - Servers
  - Industrial Control Systems (ICS) / Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems
  - Embedded systems
  - Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
  - Internet of Things (IoT) devices

## Wireless Devices
- **Installation Considerations**: Factors such as site surveys and heat maps are taken into account to ensure optimal placement and coverage of wireless devices.

## Mobile Solutions
- **Mobile Device Management (MDM)**: Implementing solutions to manage and secure mobile devices within the organization, including features like remote wipe and device encryption.
- **Deployment Models**: Different approaches to managing mobile devices, including:
  - Bring Your Own Device (BYOD): Allowing employees to use their personal devices for work purposes.
  - Corporate-Owned, Personally-Enabled (COPE): Providing employees with company-owned devices for both work and personal use.
  - Choose Your Own Device (CYOD): Giving employees the option to select their preferred device from a list of approved devices.
- **Connection Methods**: Ensuring secure connectivity options for mobile devices, including cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

## Wireless Security Settings
- **Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)**: The latest standard for securing Wi-Fi networks, providing stronger encryption and authentication compared to its predecessor, WPA2. WPA3 enhances security by using Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), also known as Dragonfly Key Exchange, which protects against offline dictionary attacks.
- **AAA/Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)**: A networking protocol that provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for users attempting to access network resources. RADIUS servers are commonly used in enterprise environments to authenticate users connecting to Wi-Fi networks, VPNs, and other network services.

## Application Security
- Ensuring the security of applications through various measures, such as:
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks
  - Secure cookies to protect session data
  - Static code analysis to identify vulnerabilities
  - Code signing to verify the integrity of application code

## Sandboxing
- Isolating applications or processes from the rest of the system to prevent malicious actions and contain potential threats.

## Monitoring
- Implementing monitoring solutions to track and analyze network traffic, system activity, and security events for early detection and response to cyber threats.
