# Investigation: Data Sources

## Log Data
Log data from various sources serves as a critical component in supporting investigations. Some common log data sources include:

- **Firewall Logs**: Records of network traffic passing through the firewall, including information about allowed and denied connections.
- **Application Logs**: Logs generated by applications, providing insights into application behavior, errors, and user activities.
- **Endpoint Logs**: Logs generated by endpoint devices such as computers, servers, and mobile devices, capturing information about system events, user activities, and security-related events.
- **OS-Specific Security Logs**: Operating system logs that focus on security-related events, such as authentication attempts, privilege escalations, and system changes.
- **IPS/IDS Logs**: Logs generated by Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), containing information about detected threats and suspicious network activity.
- **Network Logs**: Logs from network devices such as routers, switches, and load balancers, providing visibility into network traffic, device status, and connectivity issues.
- **Metadata**: Additional contextual information associated with log events, such as timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, user identities, and event severity.

## Data Sources
Apart from log data, investigations can leverage various other data sources for gathering evidence and insights:

- **Vulnerability Scans**: Reports generated from vulnerability scans, highlighting security weaknesses and potential attack vectors within the network or systems.
- **Automated Reports**: Automated reports generated by security tools and systems, summarizing security events, incidents, and compliance status.
- **Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards displaying real-time or historical data related to security metrics, alerts, and incidents.
- **Packet Captures**: Captured network traffic data at the packet level, providing detailed insights into network communications, protocols, and anomalies.
