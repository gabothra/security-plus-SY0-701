# Vulnerability Management

## Vulnerability Lifecycle
- **Identification Methods**: Techniques for discovering vulnerabilities in systems or applications.
- **Analysis**: Evaluation of vulnerabilities to determine their impact and prioritize remediation efforts.
- **Vulnerability Response and Remediation**: Implementing fixes or mitigations to address identified vulnerabilities.
- **Validation of Remediation**: Ensuring that the remediation actions taken have effectively resolved the vulnerabilities.
- **Reporting**: Communicating the status of vulnerabilities and remediation efforts to stakeholders.

## Identification Methods
- **Vulnerability Scan**: Automated scans of systems or networks to identify known vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: Using a vulnerability scanner like Nessus or OpenVAS to scan a network for known vulnerabilities.
- **Application Security**: Assessing the security of software applications to identify vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: Using static analysis tools to review source code for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Threat Feed**: Monitoring external sources for information about new vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: Subscribing to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for information on new vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Simulating attacks on systems to identify vulnerabilities.
  - *Example*: Hiring a security firm to conduct penetration tests on a web application to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Responsible Disclosure Programme**: Encouraging individuals to report vulnerabilities in a responsible manner.
  - *Example*: Offering a bug bounty program to reward researchers for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Analysis
- **Confirmation**: Verifying the existence of vulnerabilities identified during the identification phase.
- **Prioritize**: Ranking vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
- **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**: A standardized method for assessing the severity of vulnerabilities.
- **Common Vulnerability Enumeration**: A system for uniquely identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Classification**: Categorizing vulnerabilities based on their nature and impact.
- **Exposure Factor**: Estimating the proportion of systems or data exposed to a vulnerability.
- **Environmental Variables**: Considering factors such as system configurations and network topology that may affect the impact of a vulnerability.
- **Industry/Organizational Impact**: Assessing the potential impact of a vulnerability based on industry or organizational context.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Determining the level of risk the organization is willing to accept.

## Vulnerability Response and Remediation
- **Patching**: Applying software updates or patches to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Insurance**: Transferring the risk of a vulnerability to an insurance provider.
- **Segmentation**: Isolating vulnerable systems from the rest of the network to limit the potential impact of a vulnerability.
- **Compensating Controls**: Implementing alternative security measures to mitigate the risk of a vulnerability.
- **Exceptions and Exemptions**: Granting temporary or permanent waivers for vulnerabilities that cannot be remediated.

## Validation of Remediation
- **Rescanning**: Conducting follow-up scans to verify that vulnerabilities have been remediated.
- **Audit**: Performing audits to ensure that remediation actions have been implemented correctly.
- **Verification**: Confirming that remediation actions have effectively addressed the identified vulnerabilities.

## Reporting
- **Regular Reporting**: Providing regular updates on the status of vulnerabilities and remediation efforts to stakeholders.
- **Ad Hoc Reporting**: Providing ad hoc reports in response to specific requests or incidents.
