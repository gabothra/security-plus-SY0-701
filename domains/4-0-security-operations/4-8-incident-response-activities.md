# Incident Response Activities

## Process - 7 Phases of Incident Response
The incident response process typically consists of the following seven phases:

- **Preparation**: Establishing policies, procedures, and tools necessary for effective incident response.
- **Detection**: Identifying and detecting potential security incidents through monitoring, alerts, or other means.
- **Analysis**: Investigating and analyzing the nature and scope of the incident to determine its impact and severity.
- **Containment**: Implementing measures to prevent the incident from spreading further and causing additional damage.
- **Eradication**: Removing the root cause of the incident and eliminating any malicious presence from the environment.
- **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems, data, and services to normal operation and ensuring business continuity.
- **Lessons Learned**: Conducting a post-incident review to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the incident response process.

## Training
Providing training to incident response teams to ensure they are well-equipped with the knowledge and skills required to effectively respond to security incidents.

## Testing
Conducting exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of the incident response plan and the readiness of the incident response team. This includes tabletop exercises and simulations that mimic real-world scenarios.

## Root Cause Analysis
Investigating and identifying the underlying causes and contributing factors that led to the security incident, allowing organizations to address fundamental issues and prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Threat Hunting
Proactively searching for signs of malicious activity or security threats within an organization's environment, aiming to identify and mitigate potential risks before they escalate into security incidents.

## Digital Forensics
Utilizing forensic techniques and tools to investigate security incidents, collect evidence, and analyze digital artifacts. This includes practices such as legal hold, chain of custody, data acquisition, preservation, reporting, and e-discovery.
